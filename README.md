# Optic Fiber Network Visualization
## Description
In this project, I have shown an ISP's fiber network through Google Maps.
With this software, an ISP can view all information about their cable network and manage where they have their optic fiber cable. They can also see how many cores are available or used in an optical fiber cable.

**Technologies I have used in this project are:**  React Js, Node Js, MongoDB, and express Js, Google Map API.
